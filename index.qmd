I spend too much time playing with data and not enough time writing my dissertation! Yay! This is my attempt at making a personal website. I will hopefully make it more "professional" soon.

## Research

**Cook County Property Taxes**

I am currently working with CMAP and the Cook County people looking at property taxes using data from the Cook County Assessor's Office. I've been insisting on making all data, findings, code, and bonus content publicly available on GitHub. A website with key findings and tables [can be found here!](https://aleawm.github.io/CookCounty-PropertyTaxes/)

**Fiscal Futures Project**

My little legacy is this GitHub Site and Repository! I joined Fiscal Futures Project in 2021 and transformed the inherited Stata code into R code, while finding errors in past methodology and updating the methodology for the project. Was I asked to do this? No, but I have no chill. What began as personal documentation to track coding logic and my deep dives into the data slowly warped into an RPubs site and then became a full-blown GitHub website.
