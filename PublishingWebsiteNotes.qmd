title: "Tips for Publishing a Website on GitHub"
---

1.  Personal Website vs Project website
    -   Until 2/25/24, I had only been using Project Sites for my repositories
        -   ex. <https://aleawm.github.io/Fiscal-Futures/> goes to a site created for a Project

        -   links ends with whatever the Repository is called
    -   For this group, I finally created a "User Website"
        -   Makes link short and sweet

        -   <https://aleawm.github.io/> goes to my "User Page." Main perk is the shorter link.
2.  You must fully render the website before you publish it.
    -   in the Terminal, you can do `quarto render`
    -   or in the `Build` tab you can click `Render Project/Website/Book` (word depends on what type of project you created)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  Check your work! HTML files should show up in your project folder
    -   if using GitHub to host your website and using the gh-pages for publishing your website,

## Publishing through the Terminal!

I typed this into the terminal:

`quarto publish gh-pages`

And then was prompted with this:
