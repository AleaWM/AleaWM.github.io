title: "Tips for Publishing a Website on GitHub"
---

1.  You must fully render the website before you publish it.

-   in the Terminal, you can do `quarto render`
-   or in the `Build` tab you can click `Render Project/Website/Book` (word depends on what type of project you created)

2.  Check your work! HTML files should show up in your project folder

-   if using GitHub to host your website and using the gh-pages for publishing your website,

3.  Personal Website vs Project website
